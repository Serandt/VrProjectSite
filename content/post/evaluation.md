The evaluation was conducted by 3 participants (including myself).
The data is partly the results and scores of participants when playing the game and also from a questionnaire after the study.
Here you can take a look at the questions: [Link to the questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSft38s6lG3D4BoNAtaNU6Pfu0SjK6W6yxPuwn58_U66yHDVtA/viewform)


### Result

Here are the average scores while playing:

* Time per round:           164.23s
* Time per task:            18.8s
* Time per enemy:           4.59s
* Accuracy (#enemy/#projectiles):       55.89%
* Projectiles used for single enemy:        2.25
* Coins collected:          55 (69)


### General

For this participants were asked to answer in a scale from 1-10 having 1 as "low" and 10 as "high".

* Motion Sickness:          6
* Presence:             7
* Fun:              7.3


### Difficulty

This was evaluated on a scale from 1-5 having 1 as "easy" and 5 as "hard".
Participants were asked to rate the level of difficulty in the following three aspects.

* Locomotion:           3.67
* Interaction:          2.33
* Stay in pose:         4


### Speed

Players were also asked to rate the speed of the movement in the different directions to see how they perceive it so those values can be changed in the future.
This was measured in a scale from 1-5 (very SLow â€“ very fast).

* Forward:              2.67
* Up/Down:              3.33
* Rotation:             2.67


### Fatigue

This was the only question participants had to answer twice: once before and once after playing.
I evaluated with the scale of 1-4 (not at all, slightly, moderate, very) used in the virtual reality sickness questionnaire (Kim, 2018).
My intention was to evaluate how players' level of fatigue changed after having to go on their knees for a longer period of time.

* Before:           2
* After:            2.67


### Feedback

Participants were also asked to give feedback for their experience:

* It was fun to defeat the ghosts und to put them into the portal
* It was really fun!
* The forward movement was exhausting after some time for my legs
* It was difficult to see the wand (too dark and small)
