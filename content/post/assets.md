Assets are essential for making this game more immersive. 
In other words I needed a broom on wich players can drive and control the movemet.
A wand was also needed for the interaction part as well as many other items.

Because I know a little about 3D-modelling using blender I decided to make them my self.
Changes were made in unity for final touches like gloom, size and orientation.
