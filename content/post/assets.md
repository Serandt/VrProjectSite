## 3D-Models

Assets are essential for making this game more immersive. 
In other words I needed a broom on wich players can drive and control the movemet.
A wand was also needed for the interaction part as well as many other items.

Because I know a little about 3D-modelling using blender I decided to make them my self.
Changes were made in unity for final touches like gloom, size and orientation.

### Wand

The darker wand was the first version. After the evaluation feedback I changed the texture to make it more visible in the environment.

## Animations

For the reverse classroom I followed the tutorial by IHeartGameDev: Animations in Unity3D.
I would really recomend this tutorial for understanding how to make basic idle animations in Unity.
For further understanding there will be more knowledge needed (e.g. triggering an animation or using the animator for managing different animations of a single object).

I also added new animations for objects to make them more lively. Those were also basic idle animations for the ghosts, portal and wand.
The wand animation is stopped when players grab it and the ghost animation stops when the got captured.

## Sound

I added a magic beam sound while shooting with the wand. The free sond was found [here](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/sweep/).

I changed the music of the environment by making it more adventure like with this free music I got from [here](https://www.chosic.com/download-audio/28030/).

And here the needed aknoledgement needed for using the music:
