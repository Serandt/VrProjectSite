to make the experience more magical and immersive I decided to make some changes in the environment.

Starting by changing the color of the light aswell as the sky from having a normal skybox to having a dark blueish color to simulate the night sky.

Also more lamps were added to the scene and the Prefabs of them were modified to look like they are glowing.

Because the given music didn't match to the setting I was trying to get, I decided to change it with something more mysterious and adventurer like.
