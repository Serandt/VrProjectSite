The idea started as a teleportation using a bow and an arrow. To my "surprise" there were two other people wanting to do this aswell.

That's why I came to this super fun idea of making something like a driving simulator using a segway. One of those vehicles with two wheels for drivong around by leaning.

A week after starting the implementation I realized it wasn't as lame as I imagined. It was worst.

So... It happened that I was watching a certain movie and came to that thought: "Wouldn't it be cool to fly around using a broom?"

Then came this cool idea of also defeating enemies. This will be replacing the interaction with the T-shape given in the original project to match with the setting of my idea for the parkour.

That's how Broom Quest - Ghost Hunt came to life!
